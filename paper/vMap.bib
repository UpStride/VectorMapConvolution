	Abstract = {At present, the vast majority of machine learning and deep learning methods operate on real-valued data. The data distribution as well as intermediate features are represented as real numbers. Recent work on recurrent neural networks suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Residual network architectures for training very deep neural networks have also seen widespread adoption.In this work, we present a general formulation for complex-valued feed-forward architectures and apply it to convolutional residual networks. We also present complex batch-normalization, a weight initialization strategy for complex-valued neural nets and an end-to-end trainable convolutional neural network based on complex convolutions and representations. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are able to achieve comparable or better performance than their real-valued counterparts.},
